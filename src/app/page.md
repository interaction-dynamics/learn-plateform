This learning platform is a work in progress. If you have any feedback, please [open an issue](https://github.com/interaction-dynamics/learn-plateform/issues).
{% /callout %}

This platform is not like other programming courses. It won't teach you how to code, but it will teach you how to code better. It gathers the best practices in front-end development to help you become a better developer. Hope it will be useful to you!{% .lead %}

## Concept

### Curated list

This platform is a curated list of best practices to improve your skills in front-end development.We keep it up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies. We also try to keep it as simple as possible. We don't want to overwhelm you with too much information.

### Opinionated

In order to be efficient, this platform can't cover all the possible ways to do things. The curated list of best practices is opinionated. It means that we will tell you what we think is the best way to do things. It doesn't mean that it is the only way to do things.

### Not the basics

The goal of this platform is to improve your skills in front-end development. If you are junior, you will probably learn a lot of things. If you are senior, you will probably learn a few things. But this platform is not designed to teach you how to code from scratch. We suggest to start with some other resources to learn the basics of programming.

## Quick start

We suggest to read the whole introduction chapter first. It will give you a good overview of the platform, the goal and how it works. The rest of the pages are designed to be as independent as possible. So, you can jump to a specific page if you want to learn something specific.

You won't need all the skills described in this platform to be a good front-end developer. But the more you know, the better you will be. You can also consider this platform as a reference. You can come back to it when you need to learn something specific.
