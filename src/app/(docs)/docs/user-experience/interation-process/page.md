Based on all the unknowns and changing expectations, it is not possible to have a perfect product from day 1. Instead, the best practices are to follow an iterative process to design and build the product and to improve it at every iteration.

There are multiple methods of iteration process like Scrum or Design Thinking Process. They are not mutually exclusive and can be used together. Some of the methods are oriented to the development process, while others are more focused on the design process.

## Design Thinking Process

The Design Thinking Process is an interative method to design used by UX Designers. You shouldn't have to follow this method yourself as a developer since it doesn't impact the code but the only the prototypes designed by UX Designers. But it is important to know the steps to understand the design process and to collaborate with the designers.

## Scrum

Once of the benefit of the Scrum methodology is to work in iterations called sprints. The goal is to deliver during sprints a working product that can be tested by the users. The feedback from the users is used to improve the product in the next sprints. It is a good way to improve different aspects like bug fixes but also the user experience.
