Server side rendering is a technique used to improve the performance of your website. It consists in rendering the HTML of your website on the server instead of the client. Instead of dowloading the asset, rendering the HTML with javascript on the client, and fetching the data to rehydrate the page, the server sends the HTML already rendered. This way, the user can see the content of the page faster.

## Frameworks

A lot of frameworks provide server side rendering:
