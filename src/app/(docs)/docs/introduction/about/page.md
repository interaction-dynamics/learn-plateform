{% avatar src="/assets/avatar.jpeg" alt="Thibault Friedrich" caption="Thibault Friedrich" /%}

This platform is maintained by Thibault Friedrich, a senior software engineer with a passion for web technologies. He started coding when he was 12 years old and never stopped since. He has been working in the tech industry for more than **10 years** as a developer, a team leader, and a CTO.

With two master's degrees mixing **computer science** and **UX**, he loves to work on the intersection of these two domains.

Even if Thibault worked with a lot of technologies (Php, python, Java, C#, C++, etc), he has always been focused on **web technologies**. He started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, then he worked with a lot of frameworks and libraries (jQuery, Angular, React, Vue, etc).

In order to extend his knowlegde about user interfaces, he also worked in the **VR** and **AR** domains and home automation field.

With a appetite for the **job well done**, he is always looking for the best practices and the latest technologies to deliver a product that is easy to maintain and extend. Discussing and working with other experienced developers allows him to keep up to date.

His favorite stack is currently **Next.js+taiwindcss+typescript+prisma+postgresql**. He loves to work with these technologies because they are easy to use, easy to maintain, and easy to extend.
