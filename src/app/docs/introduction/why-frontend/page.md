    description: Why this platform teaches only front-end development?
---

The front-end development requires less technical knowledge to get started and the ecosystem is really welcoming. However, it is consistently evolving and it can be hard to keep up with the latest trends. It also requires very different skills like Ux and Accessibility to master. It is a very challenging field to work in.

## Differences with other fields

### Competitive

Since it is the most accessible part of the web development stack, it is also the most competitive. You will have to be better than other front-end developers to get a job.

### User-centered

Front-end is the web development stack that users interact with. As a front-end developer, you have to implement features very specific to users needs and it often brings challenges to keep the code maintainable and maintain the good velocity over time.

## Scope of this platform

A lot of topics like **Productivity** or **Code craftsmanship** are not specific to front-end development. So if you are back-end developer, you can still learn a lot from this platform.

However, in order to keep the platform relevant, this platform focuses on only front-end development.
