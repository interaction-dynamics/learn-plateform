**Becoming better** is always relative. It depends on your goals and your context. However, there are some common traits that make a better developer.

## Why better?

A developer in a tech organization is the one transforming specifications into a product using computer science. Computer science brings a lot of competitive advantages in comparison of other industries. The key to success is to leverage these advantages and to be able to deliver product but also maintain it over time and keep it up to date with the latest technologies.

A common practice in the tech industry is to scratch a product to create a better version of the same product. This is often the clue that the product was implemented without following the best practices. This is a waste of time and money. It is better to keep the product up to date and maintainable.

The role of a developer is to make the difference between a product that will be maintained and a product that will be scratched. Developers shouldn't expect product owners or project manager to give some bandwidth for maintaince.

Being better means being able to deliver a product that will be maintained over time so that your organization can save money and time, and be more competitive.

## How to become better?

They are four identified axes to improve your skills as a developer:

- **Code craftsmanship**: write code that is easy to maintain and extend.
- **Front-end engineering**: use the latest technologies to have a performant product.
- **User experience**: communicate with design teams and take into account the user experience to deliver a product that is easy to use.
- **Productivity**: deliver a product in a short amount of time.

In addition of reading the documentation, we also recommend to work on side-projects to practice and improve your skills.

Also, apply for a job as soon as possible. Never consider, you are not good enough. You will learn a lot by working with other developers and by working on real projects.

Finally, never consider your skills as acquired. The tech industry is moving fast and you need to keep up to date with the latest technologies and best practices.
