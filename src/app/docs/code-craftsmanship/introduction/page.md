The code craftsmanship is a movement promoting the quality of the code based on the experience of developers instead of absolute rules. It is often opposed to the code engineering which is based on the application of rules without taking into account the context.

Since the context is a main component of the code craftsmanship, you should consider the rules described in this chapter as guidelines only. There are always exceptions to these rules.

Up to you as a developer to decide if you should follow the rules or not. But you should always be able to explain why you decided to follow or not a rule.
